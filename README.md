## Project Overview 
ðŸ’°
* The goal of this project was to create an interactive front-end cryptocurrency news application that utilizes the CSS framework other than Boostrap, two server-side APIs, and client-side storage to store data

* CSS Framework:
1. Bulma https://bulma.io

* Two server-side APIs:
1. https://docs.coincap.io/
2. https://currentsapi.services/en

* When a user goes to CryptoCash NEWS Then theyâ€™re presented with a site header, a search bar, the top 5 market-cap cryptocurrencies and a random stack of news articles.

* When i click one of the top 5 cryptocurrencies/ then i get 5 news articles from around the web related to that crypto.

* When I type a cryptocurrency into the search bar and click the search button/ then i am presented with a ticker with relevant crypto data, and iâ€™m presented with 5 news articles from around the web


* The user's events will be saved even upon refreshing.
